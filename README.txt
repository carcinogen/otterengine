What is OtterEngine?
------------------------------------------------
OtterEngine is an HTML template/expedition engine, developed in PHP.  Its design principle is to make
development of both front end and backend features cleaner, faster, and generally more pleasant.


System Requirements
------------------------------------------------
PHP 5.3+

Installation/Use
------------------------------------------------
Save the OtterEngine folder to a location accessible to your PHP script.  
Include or require the library "otterengine.class.php" in your script.
By default, the class should be located in the root of the OtterEngine folder.

In your script, define a new OtterEngine object.

$otter = new otter();

Define any necessary elements:

$otter->addLink('link1', 'http://google.com', 'Click to visit google');

Echo the rendered HTML template:

$html = "my_template.html";

echo $otter->renderTemplate($html);

In your HTML, you simply have to add {{link1}}, and OtterEngine will insert your defined tag to that location.

<body>
<div class="links">{{link}}</div>
